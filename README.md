==================

School Java Project. Inventory and Shopping System.
----------------------------------------------------

This was a project made for our high school exams by me and Nitin, my classmate.

Made on NetBeans using Java with the Swing GUI interface, this application uses MySQL(not included here) to store a set of
classified products in tables. The products are displayed to the "customer" through the interface and he can add the
products to his cart, remove them and purchase them as he would do on an online shopping portal. There is also a system
for people to register and login so as to personalise their shopping experience to a limited extent.
